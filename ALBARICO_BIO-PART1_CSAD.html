        <h2>If addiction to alcohol is called Alcoholic, then the addiction to AI is what I call A.I.holic.</h2>
        <p>My daily routine cannot leave without the use of AI. From completing tasks to becoming my therapist, I was hooked, like drugs to an addict. <em>It’s scary.</em></p>
        <p>When I feel sad, I seek AI. When I reflect, I use AI. When I have a problem with a task, I ask AI. When I study, I learn with AI.</p>
        <p>The patterns of behavior are clear, it shows dependency. But why? That’s the important question. Why am I addicted when before I could do things self-sufficiently?</p>
        <p>I think the reason is that it's convenient, it's fast, and efficient. It reduces cognitive load, or in other words <q>Hindi ka nag-iisip.</q> It also provides immediate feedback, which gives you a great dose of dopamine, and dopamine is addictive. Most of the time, those feedbacks are often what you want to hear, not the truth.</p>
        <p>I often use AI aside from work to analyze my thoughts. I like being able to understand my emotions clearly and know the reason why I feel them. It gives me the immediate answer without the experience of struggling to think and reflect deeply when it is only a prompt away.</p>
        <p>But that’s the problem, I am no longer thinking. At this point, I am probably brain-dead, and it has been replaced by AI. AI should and must not replace cognitive functions such as thinking because, as humans, we possess the superior ability to think, which is what makes us different from other animals.</p>
        <p>We are intellectual beings capable of creations through the use of our cognitive abilities; if this is no longer in use can we even call ourselves humans. AI should not serve as our brain; it should be treated like a Google search, where you ask questions about certain topics instead of browsing the internet for hours just to get the answer. Just because it’s convenient, fast and efficient, it does not mean we should abuse it. <em>There is a limit to everything.</em></p>
        <p>AI is a wonderful tool, but it should be used correctly and appropriately so it does not turn into addiction or dependence. I am aware of this and will make conscious decisions and choices to reduce my consumption of it. Because I am a human, I already have my innate tools within me that I used AI for. From this day forward, <em>I will no longer be an A.I.holic. I am my own tool. I will be Izylle.</em></p><br>
