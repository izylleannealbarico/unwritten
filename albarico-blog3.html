      <h2>I want to be a trillionaire so bloody bad, standing next to Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates. Because every time I look into the future, I see myself as an Idol.</h2>
 
      <p>Reading this, you might think I am crazy or wishing myself a pipe dream; you're not wrong, but you're not right. In order to succeed, you need to strive for grandeur and everything that life can offer; even if you miss the moon, you land among the stars.</p>

<p>In the next 5 years, at the age of 25 years old.  I graduated from college as a Computer Science bachelor, and am working either in a research and development company or in a startup company of my own. I want to be part of something that challenges me intellectually and makes me work myself to the bone. I plan to be a senior software engineer and a team lead for my first 2-5 years in a company. And after 10 years, I want to rank up and become a CEO. Or start establishing my own company by gathering fellow employees, investors, experiences, and accreditation from work.</p>
  
  <p>I personally don't want to work under anyone; I want full executive control of a company's direction by being in charge of the strategic plans and goals. I want complete control of the vision, manage resources, and be the one to make it happen. I am not someone who goes against their personal values; I hold them closely to consciousness, it’s my identity. The only thing that keeps me human instead of a dictator.  I cannot act if it does not align with my values and vision for the outcome. I really want to be a leader because my goal is simple, which is to change lives for the better through revolutionizing the tech industry in the Philippines. Creating jobs and opportunities for my fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>I want to be rich, real rich. Where millions became pennies to me. But what I really want the most in this lifetime is to help my country. It has been my mission and vow since I was seven years old to contribute to something bigger than myself that will last for generations. Sa pinakamamahal kong Pilipinas, I’ll be your idol.</p>
