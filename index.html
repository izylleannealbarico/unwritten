            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        </section>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><em><q>Imagination is more important than knowledge,</q></em> by Albert
                Einstein.</b><sup style="color: blue;">[1]</sup>This is the quotation that perfectly encapsulates my <b>childhood</b>, which is filled with
            imagination, curiosity, and a deep passion for Science.<sup style="color: blue;">[2]</sup> I grew up in a home that supported my endeavors and
            interests despite being in a single-parent household, <em>hindi nagkulang si Mommy</em>.<sup style="color: blue;">[3]</sup> My mother would buy
            me
            books ranging from science dictionaries to general physics starting from a young age of seven.<sup style="color: blue;">[4]</sup> My family
            would
            entertain my endless inquisition and my own formulated theories about the universe, the world, and reality.<sup style="color: blue;">[5]</sup>
            There’s a passage from one of my science books that left a lasting impression on me and shaped who I am
            today,
            which goes along the lines of, “Question everything, challenge every information you read and obtain, seek
            the
            truth yourself because science is ever changing.”<sup style="color: blue;">[6]</sup> I was a scientist at heart, and it was indeed my goal to
            become one until I was in senior high school.<sup style="color: blue;">[7]</sup> I pledged to the seven-year-old self that, whatever happens, I
            would dedicate my life to science.<sup style="color: blue;">[8]</sup> However, my childhood didn’t just revolve around Science;<sup style="color: blue;">[9]</sup> I was also an
            academic achiever consistently since elementary school.<sup style="color: blue;">[10]</sup> I would constantly study at school and at home.<sup style="color: blue;">[11]</sup> I
            didn’t
            do or give time to do anything else but study in advance, do my assignments, review, and what I considered a
            reward for accomplishing everything, which is to read physics or science books in my spare time.<sup style="color: blue;">[12]</sup> At school,
            I
            would say I’m quite a teacher’s pet, especially my teachers in Science and Math, because these are the
            classes
            where my teachers clearly see how passionate I am for these subjects, while still being active and excelling
            in
            other classes.<sup style="color: blue;">[13]</sup> There is this one feedback from one of my teachers in Grade 6 that further supports this:
            <i><q>Whoever your teacher might be, they are lucky because they have you in their class actively
                    participating.</q></i><sup style="color: blue;">[14]</sup> Receiving that feedback, I was touched because the philosophy or the mindset
            I applied to every class I attended, I’ll make sure my time there was worthwhile.<sup style="color: blue;">[15]</sup> I left the class learning
            something, and the teacher felt satisfied and respected for their time.<sup style="color: blue;">[16]</sup> Despite the achievements and feats,
            I
            struggled with socializing.<sup style="color: blue;">[17]</sup> I had little to no friends, that's what held me back for years, up until Senior
            High
            School, where everything changed because now I am and have no choice but to socialize.<sup style="color: blue;">[18]</sup> This period of my
            life
            cemented the work ethic that helped me in my survival in Senior High.<sup style="color: blue;">[19]</sup> the passion for science is a
            blueprint
            for choosing STEM.<sup style="color: blue;">[20]</sup>

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        </section>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><b><q>When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.</q></b></em>.<sup style="color: blue;">[1]</sup> It is a
            proverb
            that sums up my <b>teenage</b> years.<sup style="color: blue;">[2]</sup> I would describe this period as challenging, difficult, and traumatic,
            as
            well as impactful, because through the things I experienced during this period of my life, I have changed
            for
            the better.<sup style="color: blue;">[3]</sup> I would even say a few steps closer to my ideal self.<sup style="color: blue;">[4]</sup> This showcases how meaningful this period
            truly is.<sup style="color: blue;">[5]</sup> In my teenage years, a lot of the changes and experiences I encountered were from school,
            especially
            in Senior High School.<sup style="color: blue;">[6]</sup> I studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran, Manila, under a full scholarship.<sup style="color: blue;">[7]</sup> It was
            the
            first time I was challenged severely in different aspects of my being, in terms of mentally, physically, and
            emotionally.<sup style="color: blue;">[8]</sup> Through this extremely structured, hectic, and pressuring environment, I was able to force
            myself
            to adapt valuable skills like planning, scheduling, discipline, and sacrifice to keep up and maintain my
            grades
            and scholarship.<sup style="color: blue;">[9]</sup> My work ethic at that time was extremely unhealthy.<sup style="color: blue;">[10]</sup> I would starve myself until I am done
            with
            my task and studies.<sup style="color: blue;">[11]</sup> I will only stop when my stomach is hurting painfully.<sup style="color: blue;">[12]</sup> At that time, I would study from
            3
            AM until I fell asleep, nonstop.<sup style="color: blue;">[13]</sup> I would also study until I felt like vomiting, and I would constantly feel
            like
            my nape felt hot or a slightly uncomfortable feeling.<sup style="color: blue;">[14]</sup> In addition, I would study in advance in preparation
            for
            major exams 3 weeks early.<sup style="color: blue;">[15]</sup> During the 1st week of the month, I'm already advanced reading, and that's every
            single day.<sup style="color: blue;">[16]</sup> My mother was concerned about my health and would constantly remind me to eat because it had
            reached
            the point that I wouldn't even leave my room because of the number of things piled up.<sup style="color: blue;">[17]</sup> But despite that, I
            met
            people who changed me socially, such as my classmate and the class president, especially the class
            president.<sup style="color: blue;">[18]</sup>
            This person, despite my lack of social cues and even introverted nature, would always greet me and include
            me in
            her group, especially during the team activities, which made everything easy for me to collaborate.<sup style="color: blue;">[19]</sup>By finding a deeply admired friend who modeled leadership and kindness, I was able to break out of my social isolation, develop the confidence to build meaningful connections, and ultimately transform into a proactive leader who embraces life beyond my own bubble.<sup style="color: blue;">[20]</sup>

            <h2>College Years</h2>
        </section>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><b><q>For all the pain, exhaustion, and silent tears that were shed, you
                        will
                        be rewarded.<sup style="color: blue;">[1]</sup> For all the endurance and resilience, you will be rewarded.<sup style="color: blue;">[2]</sup> For everything you did,
                        you
                        will eventually sigh in relief, for it has ended.</q></b></em><sup style="color: blue;">[3]</sup> This is what I would remind
            myself of
            every time I feel unmotivated and drained.<sup style="color: blue;">[4]</sup> <b>College</b> is not easy, so my piece of advice is to either
            choose
            what you love wholeheartedly or something that you find interesting and impactful.<sup style="color: blue;">[5]</sup> I chose Computer Science
            out
            of intellectual stimulation and my desire to contribute to my country, and to keep my promise I had made
            with
            myself thirteen years ago to dedicate myself to Science.<sup style="color: blue;">[6]</sup> Despite a different path or course of life, my love
            for
            physics, which I had planned to pursue ever since I was young, is still with me but has taken a different
            form
            and still serves the same purpose.<sup style="color: blue;">[7]</sup> I would be honest, I had an existential crisis and wasn't even sure if I
            could continue this course because I was not that happy compared to when I am studying Physics but happiness
            doesn't just come from what you do but the reason why and the purpose it serve, the community you had built
            and
            have, and the people you meet along the way.<sup style="color: blue;">[8]</sup> In the first year, I was struggling, but I made friends who
            have
            supported me in this journey.<sup style="color: blue;">[9]</sup> I was not alone because I had the skills and the tools from my teenage years
            behind my back, helping me navigate this new experience.<sup style="color: blue;">[10]</sup> In my second year, I have finally adjusted and have
            now
            started every opportunity I have.<sup style="color: blue;">[11]</sup> I have become an Education and Research Committee of the University
            Student
            Council, A class Representative, and A project management team unit member of the CCSS Research and
            Development
            Unit, all at once which ultimately lead to a severe burnout to a point that I would ask support and
            encouragement from my friends to power through and during the finals I was crying every single day because I
            would continuously work without rest.<sup style="color: blue;">[12]</sup> I really experience things that I thought I had already experience but
            I
            was wrong because before I would only just get sick when I burnout, experience headaches from the lack of
            sleep,
            stomach ache, and that’s it but now I experience cognitive overload to the point I no longer process and
            absorb
            information, I would get sick frequently as well, and now I cry not because I am sick and working, I cry
            because
            I am severely exhausted but still working.<sup style="color: blue;">[13]</sup> Last semester was really traumatic and severe, but because of
            that, I
            have learned my limits, I have known what I am only capable of handling, and have removed my hesitation from
            exploring because I did and joined everything that I was interested in.<sup style="color: blue;">[14]</sup> I have learned the importance and
            significance of rest because without rest, I am not, and no one is productive;<sup style="color: blue;">[15]</sup> all the people involved and
            the
            quality of our work will be affected.<sup style="color: blue;">[16]</sup> These lessons and periods of my life shaped me into who I am becoming.<sup style="color: blue;">[17]</sup>
            I
            want to be proud of who I have become, not from the validation and recognition from others, but from myself.<sup style="color: blue;">[18]</sup>
            <em title="My philosophy in life."><b>My journey doesn't just stop at college or during my academic years,
                    but
                    it's a lifelong journey of improving, overcoming challenges, meeting new people.<sup style="color: blue;">[19]</sup>Having new
                    experiences that lead to a path towards a fulfilling and meaningful life.</b></em><sup style="color: blue;">[20]</sup>
