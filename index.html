        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><em><q>Imagination is more important than knowledge,</q></em> by Albert
            Einstein.</b>This is the quotation that perfectly encapsulates my <b>childhood</b>, which is filled with
        imagination, curiosity, and a deep passion for Science. I grew up in a home that supported my endeavors and
        interests despite being in a single-parent household, <em>hindi nagkulang si Mommy</em>. My mother would buy me
        books ranging from science dictionaries to general physics starting from a young age of seven. My family would
        entertain my endless inquisition and my own formulated theories about the universe, the world, and reality.
        There’s a passage from one of my science books that left a lasting impression on me and shaped who I am today,
        which goes along the lines of, “Question everything, challenge every information you read and obtain, seek the
        truth yourself because science is ever changing.” I was a scientist at heart, and it was indeed my goal to
        become one until I was in senior high school. I pledged to the seven-year-old self that, whatever happens, I
        would dedicate my life to science. However, my childhood didn’t just revolve around Science; I was also an
        academic achiever consistently since elementary school. I would constantly study at school and at home. I didn’t
        do or give time to do anything else but study in advance, do my assignments, review, and what I considered a
        reward for accomplishing everything, which is to read physics or science books in my spare time. At school, I
        would say I’m quite a teacher’s pet, especially my teachers in Science and Math, because these are the classes
        where my teachers clearly see how passionate I am for these subjects, while still being active and excelling in
        other classes. There is this one feedback from one of my teachers in Grade 6 that further supports this:
        <i><q>Whoever your teacher might be, they are lucky because they have you in their class actively
                participating.</q></i> Receiving that feedback, I was touched because the philosophy or the mindset I
        applied to every class I attended, I’ll make sure my time there was worthwhile. I left the class learning
        something, and the teacher felt satisfied and respected for their time. Despite the achievements and feats, I
        struggled with socializing. I had little to no friends, that's what held me back for years, up until Senior High
        School, where everything changed because now I am and have no choice but to socialize. This period of my life
        cemented the work ethic that helped me in my survival in Senior High, and the passion for science is a blueprint
        for choosing STEM.

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
    </section>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><b><q>When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.</q></b></em> It is a proverb
        that sums up my <b>teenage</b> years. I would describe this period as challenging, difficult, and traumatic, as
        well as impactful, because through the things I experienced during this period of my life, I have changed for
        the better. I would even say a few steps closer to my ideal self. This showcases how meaningful this period
        truly is. In my teenage years, a lot of the changes and experiences I encountered were from school, especially
        in Senior High School. I studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran, Manila, under a full scholarship. It was the
        first time I was challenged severely in different aspects of my being, in terms of mentally, physically, and
        emotionally. Through this extremely structured, hectic, and pressuring environment, I was able to force myself
        to adapt valuable skills like planning, scheduling, discipline, and sacrifice to keep up and maintain my grades
        and scholarship. My work ethic at that time was extremely unhealthy. I would starve myself until I am done with
        my task and studies. I will only stop when my stomach is hurting painfully. At that time, I would study from 3
        AM until I fell asleep, nonstop. I would also study until I felt like vomiting, and I would constantly feel like
        my nape felt hot or a slightly uncomfortable feeling. In addition, I would study in advance in preparation for
        major exams 3 weeks early. During the 1st week of the month, I'm already advanced reading, and that's every
        single day. My mother was concerned about my health and would constantly remind me to eat because it had reached
        the point that I wouldn't even leave my room because of the number of things piled up. But despite that, I met
        people who changed me socially, such as my classmate and the class president, especially the class president.
        This person, despite my lack of social cues and even introverted nature, would always greet me and include me in
        her group, especially during the team activities, which made everything easy for me to collaborate. This person
        was constantly kind and considerate, they took care of all the people around them, and they allowed others to
        take care of them in return. This is the first person I trusted and opened up to besides my family and siblings,
        because through this person, I was able to finally say I had a friend. I admire this person deeply; they
        motivated and inspired me to change for the better by emulating the traits and character I wish to have as my
        own, which are their leadership, kindness, consideration, thoughtfulness, composure, and competence. These are
        also the reasons why I now seek the people I want to be friends with, because I was saddened that it took until
        the end to become close. But now that I have the skills to acquire friends on my own and be confident in my
        ability to socialize, I have made friends with those I admire in the class the most, just like what I promised
        myself, <i>dadaldalin ko yung mga tao I admire and feel inspired by</i>. I am happy to say I did, and I was a
        class representative at this college last 1st semester of my 2nd year. The period of my life has built my
        character; it has helped me open up to people and experience life beyond my own bubble, but with others.

        <h2>College Years</h2>
    </section>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><b><q>For all the pain, exhaustion, and silent tears that were shed. You will
                    be rewarded. For all the endurance and resilience. You will be rewarded. For everything you did, you
                    will eventually sigh in relief, for it has ended.</q></b></em> This is what I would remind myself of
        every time I feel unmotivated and drained. <b>College</b> is not easy, so my piece of advice is to either choose
        what you love wholeheartedly or something that you find interesting and impactful. I chose Computer Science out
        of intellectual stimulation and my desire to contribute to my country, and to keep my promise I had made with
        myself thirteen years ago to dedicate myself to Science. Despite a different path or course of life, my love for
        physics, which I had planned to pursue ever since I was young, is still with me but has taken a different form
        and still serves the same purpose. I would be honest, I had an existential crisis and wasn't even sure if I
        could continue this course because I was not that happy compared to when I am studying Physics but happiness
        doesn't just come from what you do but the reason why and the purpose it serve, the community you had built and
        have, and the people you meet along the way. In the first year, I was struggling, but I made friends who have
        supported me in this journey. I was not alone because I had the skills and the tools from my teenage years
        behind my back, helping me navigate this new experience. In my second year, I have finally adjusted and have now
        started every opportunity I have. I have become an Education and Research Committee of the University Student
        Council, A class Representative, and A project management team unit member of the CCSS Research and Development
        Unit, all at once which ultimately lead to a severe burnout to a point that I would ask support and
        encouragement from my friends to power through and during the finals I was crying every single day because I
        would continuously work without rest. I really experience things that I thought I had already experience but I
        was wrong because before I would only just get sick when I burnout, experience headaches from the lack of sleep,
        stomach ache, and that’s it but now I experience cognitive overload to the point I no longer process and absorb
        information, I would get sick frequently as well, and now I cry not because I am sick and working, I cry because
        I am severely exhausted but still working. Last semester was really traumatic and severe, but because of that, I
        have learned my limits, I have known what I am only capable of handling, and have removed my hesitation from
        exploring because I did and joined everything that I was interested in. I have learned the importance and
        significance of rest because without rest, I am not, and no one is productive; all the people involved and the
        quality of our work will be affected. These lessons and periods of my life shaped me into who I am becoming. I
        want to be proud of who I have become, not from the validation and recognition from others, but from myself. <em
            title="My philosophy in life."><b>My journey doesn't just stop at college or during my academic years, but
                it's a lifelong journey of improving, overcoming challenges, meeting new people, and having new
                experiences that lead to a path towards a fulfilling and meaningful life.</b></em>
