      <h2><q>If time is money, then sleep is my luxury.</q> #SleepDeprived</h2>
 
      <p>I would describe my life as an endless hassle to succeed where needs such as rest and sleep are compromised to give more time to study or do work. I basically treated myself like a machine, no break, 24/7.</p>

<p>I was always a type A personality ever since I was young. I have been a consistent honor student from elementary until high school. In high school, studying in Letran Manila, my destructive behavior of self neglect worsened. I was no longer eating nor was I getting enough sleep. I will study from 3:00 AM until I fall asleep, then immediately get back to studying. I can’t even leave my room because of the mountain of workloads. I was basically surviving. I was running in fear. I was so desperate to keep my full scholarship that I am willing to burn myself alive from exhaustion. I was not kind to myself because I believed that I needed to work hard to feel safe and secure.</p>
  
  <p>Now that I am in college, a new story is written which is me learning to give myself the permission to sleep. The story begins by removing the conditions to sleep. I no longer sleep out of exhaustion, I sleep because I have the rights to. Not because it’s a reward but because I need to. I stopped looking at sleep as a form of want, I now see it as maintenance for me to function properly. I observed from my two years in college that if I don’t rest properly my focus, mood, health, and cognitive abilities are being compromised. It’s counterproductive, if I want to succeed, I need to take care of myself because I want and need to.</p>

<p>Sleep is like your fuel to your engine. In order to drive a car the tank should be full. To me from the past, I am sorry for treating you so horrible that you feel sad from recalling your experiences. But have no worries, I care for you the most so I will make sure to take care of you much better and healthier from this day forward. You will succeed without burning yourself to the bone. I assure you that.</p>
